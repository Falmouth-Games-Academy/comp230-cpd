# Weekly Reports

## Week 1

The most challenging thing this week was presenting my world idea to my team. I had practiced presenting beforehand so I feel like it was an improvement over my presentations last year, however I was still quite nervous and felt like I rushed it. I also found the SDL and OpenGL programming quite overwhelming but brians live coding video helped me to understand it a bit better.

## Week 2

This week I found the OpenGL programming quite challenging as It was still very overwhelming and I still don't understand it all. I plan to practice this and hopefully begin to understand how it all works. It was also quite hard to come up with a research topic for my ethics essay. 

## Week 3

This week my team decided that we will most likely be using unity to develop our game. Trying to learn scripting in C# has been the biggest challenge for me this week, I plan to practice using C# in unity at least 5 hours hours a week. I will watch video tutorials as well as implement to the team game to practice.

## Week 4
This week it was fairly challenging to come up with an interesting essay topic for the ethics essay, I spent quite a lot of time researching ethical issues in the games industry and eventually had an idea of what to base my essay on. I am still struggling with scripting in unity, I plan to spend more time working on the game and asking the BA programmer in my team when I get stuck. I was also focused on the evualtion of the usability of my previous year game for the peer review next week, this wasn't too challenging however it was fairly time consumming to get a good amount of participants to test the game.

## Week 5
This week was focused on finsihing the usability report, this was not particularly challenging but it took some time to analyse all the data i had collected. We also moved onto model loading and textures in OpenGL which I am still finding difficult to fully understand, I understand it on a basic level, however I struggle when It comes to actually implementing it in C++. After watching brians live code video I feel I am starting to become more familiar with it but definetly still need more practice. I plan to work on my OpenGL project for 5-10 hours each week, especially as it is a 90% the comp220 module.
