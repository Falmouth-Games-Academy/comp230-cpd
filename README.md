# Weekly Reports

## Week One - Beginning 25th September
First week back at university and we had quite an easy first week back. To start the week off we got a tour of the new games academy building then we had a lecture from Brian on Shaders which was very interesting. On Tuesday we had an introduction to the VR kit which was extremely fun and got me motivated ready to make my own VR creation. On Wednesday we had a lecture about ethics and professionalism. My biggest challenge this week was presenting my talk in front of my new team because I get very nervous when talking in front of groups and speed up making it take less time and talking too fast, to try and make this better I need to learn to relax and not care what happens and just make sure I get it done well.

## Week Two - Beginning 2nd October
Second week back and all is fairly chilled still. We had another lecture with Brian who did some live coding which helped explain things I was unsure of. We had another lecture with Al where we evaluated Space Chem and he made clear to us what his report is about. We had another lecture with Mike about Ethics and Professionalism which is a very interesting topic considering people have different ethics and views. My biggest challenge this week was coming up with a specific question to focus on for my essay as topics are very broad, to improve on this I will take my essay proposal to Mikes lecture and we'll get feedback on our proposals.

## Week Three - Beginnng 9th October
Third week at university and the work is starting to pile together. We had a lecture with Brian about math libaries and how we're going to have to make our own one, I understood what he was talking about in class but just to reiterate it I will look at it at home to reinforce it and will also follow his live coding example because my PC restarted randomly twice during the lecture. We had a lesson with Al and how to do his research study which was informative. My hardest challenge this week was picking an essay topic for my essay on ethics and professionalism because I finid it hard to come up with a narrow question. Luckily Mike gave me feedback and told me where and how to focus down my question. This should help me re write my proposal and come up with a better essay.

## Week Four - Beginning 16th October
This week I managed to get a triangle and a square on screen for Comp220 and I understand how to do the cube just need to map the correct coordinates, I am unsure of what we will actually be able to make in the end for this module but hopefully it goes well. We had a joint crit for our team game, I feel as if this helped our team a little bit as we were stuck for ideas for our game and it was nice to give feedback to the other team and help them make their game better. Our team needed the help to come up with more mechanics but I think we need to come up with most of the mechanics now before it's too late to add them in. To help with this I will try to communicate my own ideas with my BA team even more as this is something I fall down on.

## Week Five - Beginning 23rd October
This week was our first deadline for Al in comp 210 for which we had to make a website and analyze our date we had taken, I found this assignment a lot more fun than I expected it to be as creating a website was something new to me and something I hope to be able to learn in more depth at a later time and it is very useful, also analyzing the date wasn't too bad either. I managed to get my cube working for Brians module but overall this module is quite hard and I think will be difficult to get a good end product for this, I'm going to research GLEW and what I can do in it and hopefully that'll help me with some ideas and a little more with understanding it.

## Week Six - Beginning 30th October
The BAs want us in every day this week as it is "reading week" to work on the team game. I spent most, if not, my whole time this week working on my team game, I need to split up my time between modules equally which is something I struggle with. I feel we made some good progress with the game this week though. To help me with splitting up my time between modules I want to start making plans on how to best divide my time as to what needs doing and I reckon this will help me more because I find it easier knowing when to do what.

## Week Seven - Beginning 6th November


## Week Eight - Beginning 13th November


## Week Nine - Beginning 20th November


## Week Ten - Beginning 27th November


## Week Eleven - Beginning 4th December
This week I completely changed my idea for my VR game for the third time because I felt my other ideas were too simple, so I spent a lot of time this week trying to get the new main mechanic for my VR game working this was my biggest task this week as VR development was something quite new to me. Our team game doesn't have much for us to do at the moment as there are just bug fixes that need doing, this is annoying because there's not too much in the game, I believe it could be so much more fun by adding a few more mechanics, to do this I will communicate my ideas better with the BAs and start prototyping some mechanics to show them and see if they think they'd be a good fit and if they are itterate and make them better to add them to game.

## Week Twelve - Beginnimg 11th December
Last week of term and I spent the majoirty of this week making a few changes and trying to polish my VR game, I've come to realise some restraints to my VR game but it's too late to change that. My biggest struggle this week was the AI on my game kept on stopping working when I changed the level, I'm not too sure if this is to do with my AI or just engine fault but I plan on looking into how to make more advanced AI as AI are such important parts of games and I've come up with good game ideas  which I just need to know how to do the advanced AI for and it will also help with Ed's AI module next term. The team game didn't get changed much this week as we just wanted to build it and hand it in and are plannig what to do for it next term. Next term we need to get straight to work on the team game making it so there's more to do and more fun
