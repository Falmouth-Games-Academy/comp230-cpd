# Weekly Reports

## Week 1 - Beginning 25th September
The most challenging thing this week was presenting my world idea to my team. I had practiced presenting beforehand so I feel like it was an improvement over my presentations last year, however I was still quite nervous and felt like I rushed it. I also found the SDL and OpenGL programming quite overwhelming but brians live coding video helped me to understand it a bit better.

## Week 2 - Beginning 2nd October
This week I found the OpenGL programming quite challenging as It was still very overwhelming and I still don't understand it all. I plan to practice this and hopefully begin to understand how it all works. It was also quite hard to come up with a research topic for my ethics essay.

## Week 3 - Beginnng 9th October
This week my team decided that we will most likely be using unity to develop our game. Trying to learn scripting in C# has been the biggest challenge for me this week, I plan to practice using C# in unity at least 5 hours hours a week. I will watch video tutorials as well as implement to the team game to practice.

## Week 4 - Beginning 16th October
This week it was fairly challenging to come up with an interesting essay topic for the ethics essay, I spent quite a lot of time researching ethical issues in the games industry and eventually had an idea of what to base my essay on. I am still struggling with scripting in unity, I plan to spend more time working on the game and asking the BA programmer in my team when I get stuck. I was also focused on the evualtion of the usability of my previous year game for the peer review next week, this wasn't too challenging however it was fairly time consumming to get a good amount of participants to test the game.

## Week 5 - Beginning 23rd October
This week was focused on finsihing the usability report, this was not particularly challenging but it took some time to analyse all the data i had collected. We also moved onto model loading and textures in OpenGL which I am still finding difficult to fully understand, I understand it on a basic level, however I struggle when It comes to actually implementing it in C++. After watching brians live code video I feel I am starting to become more familiar with it but definetly still need more practice. I plan to work on my OpenGL project for 5-10 hours each week, especially as it is a 90% the comp220 module. 

## Week 6 - Beginning 30th October
This was studio practice week, however I spent the majority of this week catching up with the three essays that were due within a few weeks. I found it challenging to find motivation to work on my collaborative game, this Is something I need to improve. I shouldn't rely on motivation to work on things, I will overcome this by working on my team game or any other module whether I am motivated or not. This comes back to bad time management which Is something I am always trying to improve by setting myself goals each week for each of my differnt modules and assignments.

## Week 7 - Beginning 6th November
I got very stressed this week as there were three essays due next week, this happened to me a few times last year especially with essays. I tend to leave the majority of essay work until the week before it is due and then I get stressed out because I worry I won't be able to get it all done in time to a good standard. I ended up staying up all night to finish the last of the three essays which left me being extremely tired for lectures and studio practice the next day. This is something I want to avoid in future, I will do this by working on essays in chunks rather than all in the week before the deadline. 

## Week 8 - Beginning 13th November
I felt very relived this week after submitting my essays, however I then realised that because I had been spending so much time on them for the last couple weeks that I had not been working on my other assignments as much as I should have. I began planning out what I was going to do for my AR/VR task at the start of this week and didn't really know how I would develop it. After the comp210 workshop I watched the pluralsight tutorial on hololens which was very helpful and really kickstarted the development of my prototpye. This is a common problem for me, I think something will be easy until I try to do it then I get stuck. To overcome this I will try not to underestimate challenges and use tutorials to get me started with things I don't quite understand, such as developing for hololens.

## Week 9 - Beginning 20th November
This week the majority of my team agreed on making a new game because we were struggling to develop the previous game due to motivation issues and not really knowing how to make the game enjoyable. I was very happy with this as I wasn't enjoying developing the previous game and the new one sounded a lot more fun. However we were then faced with the challenge of creating a game with less than a month until the alpha hand in. This tested my ability to program in C# but also improved it, I found myself stuck trying to solve the same problem for hours sometimes and not asking for help. This is one of my flaws, I shy away from asking for help and tend to try and figure stuff out by myself, which can sometimes be okay, but a lot of the time it would be highly beneficial to me if I asked for some help. To overcome this I plan to ask for help whenever I can instead of wasting time trying to solve it by myself.

## Week 10 - Beginning 27th November
During this week I spent a lot of time working on my hololens project, I was having problems deploying my game to the hololens which was making it harder to develop because I couldn't test the game. After asking Al for some help I managed to get it working and I could test the game. I'm glad I asked for help rather than spending hours trying to figure it out by myself. A big challenge I faced was implementing a random item spawner for my collaborative game, I couldn't figure out how to ensure that an item wouldn't spawn in a used spawn point. I didn't ask for help for this and it took me a long time to solve this problem. I believe if I was more proficient at C# it would not have taken me so long so I plan to do a couple hours of C# practice a at least two days each week. 

## Week 11 - Beginning 4th December
This week Brian showed us how to create a class for game objects in our OpenGL projects, this was very helpful as it allowed us to easily render multiple objects in the scene. However it also meant I had to put change the C++ code that allowed bullet physics to work with my model to work with the game object class. I spent some time attempting to do this but because I couldn't do it I decided to postpone it until I had finished my other projects which were due before this. I think with some more C++ practice I will be able to solve small problems like this fairly easily. I can get this practice by working on my OpenGL project over christmas and also try some C++ challenges on hackerrank.com.

## Week 12 - Beginnimg 11th December
At the beggining of this week I was finishing my hololens project for the peer review, over the weekend I was having some issues with spacial mapping and scale but with some time I managed to sort it out in time. I got a lot of positive feedback about my project which I was very happy with, however I had to remove a song that I had in the game due to copyright issues. I also started working on a camera class for my OpenGL project and couldn't quite figure out how to get it working so I left it to do over christmas. This is something I do far too often, I will start something, get stuck and then stop working on it because I don't want to try solve the problem then. I've set myself a new goal of finishing everything I start, this will mean I won't stop working on something before I finished what I planned to have done.

## Summary 
My career goals haven't changed since last year, I still aspire to being a successful game developer in the future whether that is through starting a small indie development team, working in a large company and making AAA games or even freelancing. Now that I am half way through this degree I feel that I have learnt a huge amount about game development and believe that I have developed some good programming/scripting skills through making games and working on various projects involving programming. Five key challenges I have faced this term were communication, asking for help, problem solving, programming proficiency, and dedication. To overcome commuication I will make sure that If I have an idea or opinion I won't keep it to myself I will talk to my team about it, in addition to this if I need some help I will ask one of my teams programmers for help to improve my asking for help. To improve my programming proficiency I will complete challenges or hackerrank.com and work on my programming projects more often, this will also improve my problem solving skills. To overcome my lack of dedication I will reward myself when I complete work without delaying it and I will think about how I will benefit from doing the task earlier rather than later.
