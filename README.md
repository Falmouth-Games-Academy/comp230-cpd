# Weekly Reports

# Term One
## Week One - Beginning 25th September
First week back at university and we had quite an easy first week back. To start the week off we got a tour of the new games academy building then we had a lecture from Brian on Shaders which was very interesting. On Tuesday we had an introduction to the VR kit which was extremely fun and got me motivated ready to make my own VR creation. On Wednesday we had a lecture about ethics and professionalism. My biggest challenge this week was presenting my talk in front of my new team because I get very nervous when talking in front of groups and speed up making it take less time and talking too fast, to try and make this better I need to learn to relax and not care what happens and just make sure I get it done well.

## Week Two - Beginning 2nd October
Second week back and all is fairly chilled still. We had another lecture with Brian who did some live coding which helped explain things I was unsure of. We had another lecture with Al where we evaluated Space Chem and he made clear to us what his report is about. We had another lecture with Mike about Ethics and Professionalism which is a very interesting topic considering people have different ethics and views. My biggest challenge this week was coming up with a specific question to focus on for my essay as topics are very broad, to improve on this I will take my essay proposal to Mikes lecture and we'll get feedback on our proposals.

## Week Three - Beginnng 9th October
Third week at university and the work is starting to pile together. We had a lecture with Brian about math libaries and how we're going to have to make our own one, I understood what he was talking about in class but just to reiterate it I will look at it at home to reinforce it and will also follow his live coding example because my PC restarted randomly twice during the lecture. We had a lesson with Al and how to do his research study which was informative. My hardest challenge this week was picking an essay topic for my essay on ethics and professionalism because I finid it hard to come up with a narrow question. Luckily Mike gave me feedback and told me where and how to focus down my question. This should help me re write my proposal and come up with a better essay.

## Week Four - Beginning 16th October
This week I managed to get a triangle and a square on screen for Comp220 and I understand how to do the cube just need to map the correct coordinates, I am unsure of what we will actually be able to make in the end for this module but hopefully it goes well. We had a joint crit for our team game, I feel as if this helped our team a little bit as we were stuck for ideas for our game and it was nice to give feedback to the other team and help them make their game better. Our team needed the help to come up with more mechanics but I think we need to come up with most of the mechanics now before it's too late to add them in. To help with this I will try to communicate my own ideas with my BA team even more as this is something I fall down on.

## Week Five - Beginning 23rd October
This week was our first deadline for Al in comp 210 for which we had to make a website and analyze our date we had taken, I found this assignment a lot more fun than I expected it to be as creating a website was something new to me and something I hope to be able to learn in more depth at a later time and it is very useful, also analyzing the date wasn't too bad either. I managed to get my cube working for Brians module but overall this module is quite hard and I think will be difficult to get a good end product for this, I'm going to research GLEW and what I can do in it and hopefully that'll help me with some ideas and a little more with understanding it.

## Week Six - Beginning 30th October
The BAs want us in every day this week as it is "reading week" to work on the team game. I spent most, if not, my whole time this week working on my team game, I need to split up my time between modules equally which is something I struggle with. I feel we made some good progress with the game this week though. To help me with splitting up my time between modules I want to start making plans on how to best divide my time as to what needs doing and I reckon this will help me more because I find it easier knowing when to do what.

## Week Seven - Beginning 6th November
This week I had recieved some personal news what played a lot on my mind which led me to one of the lowest weeks of my life and to make it even worse we have 3 deadlines next week. This caused me to struggle and get into a very big panic. I now realise this is what student services are for I can go to them whenever I feel like this. This was my biggest struggle this week as I've never really acknowledged this before and know they are just there to help.

## Week Eight - Beginning 13th November
After my panic last week it was still going on a little bit but I managed to get everything in for my deadlines that I needed to. Jonny and I pair programmed two / three functions for Brians maths libary which we were happy about because initially we had no idea what we were doing, this could have been solved much easier if we had just asked for help to understand it a little better. This week we also had a peer review for our ethics essays in which I got some feedback which I hoped help me to up my grade, I felt good once I had handed in my essay because I believe it was good. My biggest struggle was the maths libary, it was a problem which was solved so easily I just needed the initial help.

## Week Nine - Beginning 20th November
This week we did post processing with Brian which I found very interesting and plan to implement myself, I don't know how I'm going to do this so I'll need to research the best way to add it in. I was feeling poorly the next few days and couldn't attend the CPD review session. My biggest struggle this week was motivation to do my work, I have periods where I feel very low and can't bring myself to do work, this is something I need help with.

## Week Ten - Beginning 27th November
This week I begun on making a new VR prototype because I felt my original idea was too simple and would be boring, I spent lots of my time this week wondering how I'd make this idea more fun and interactive but in the end decided that I should ask for help to see what Al had to say. I really wish I wouldn't leave asking for help to the last minute, I feel this is one of the things I struggle with the most and it can be solved so easily, it will also help me keep up to date on my work.

## Week Eleven - Beginning 4th December
This week I completely changed my idea for my VR game for the third time because I felt my other ideas were too simple, so I spent a lot of time this week trying to get the new main mechanic for my VR game working this was my biggest task this week as VR development was something quite new to me. Our team game doesn't have much for us to do at the moment as there are just bug fixes that need doing, this is annoying because there's not too much in the game, I believe it could be so much more fun by adding a few more mechanics, to do this I will communicate my ideas better with the BAs and start prototyping some mechanics to show them and see if they think they'd be a good fit and if they are itterate and make them better to add them to game.

## Week Twelve - Beginnimg 11th December
Last week of term and I spent the majoirty of this week making a few changes and trying to polish my VR game, I've come to realise some restraints to my VR game but it's too late to change that. My biggest struggle this week was the AI on my game kept on stopping working when I changed the level, I'm not too sure if this is to do with my AI or just engine fault but I plan on looking into how to make more advanced AI as AI are such important parts of games and I've come up with good game ideas  which I just need to know how to do the advanced AI for and it will also help with Ed's AI module next term. The team game didn't get changed much this week as we just wanted to build it and hand it in and are plannig what to do for it next term. Next term we need to get straight to work on the team game making it so there's more to do and more fun

## Career Goals
When I finish university I plan on making my own mobile games for a while then working for or starting my own small indie development team. I prefer to teach myself things I am interested in learning because then I feel very interested in what I am doing. I also want to be my own boss because I want to be responsible for what is going on then I have no one else to blame other than me and it will drive me to make the best games I can. After making games for several years I'd be interested in moving to another field in computing such as security. To help me progress towards these goals I've started researching the best ways to do mobile development and I plan on making several games over the summer for my project, I want to learn how the market works as well and what sells, as a game without sales is pointless. Over the next few years after university I will teach myself other fields of computing which I find interesting.

## Key Challenges & Smart Goals
## 1 - C++ Skills
C++ plays such a large part in computing and especailly games which is why I want to better my C++ ability. I plan on making a schedule in which I will plan my time and it will include a large chunk of time spend on learning coding better but specifically C++. I shall follow tutorials and try to make my own creations using it. This can be done over several months and can help me out with the rest of the course too. It is easy to measure as I don't really use any C++ now when making games so if I used any that'd be a big improvment.

## 2 - Motivation
Sometimes I struggle to feel motivated to do almost any work. This is why I need help to keep myself motivated, to do this I shall plan my time out each week and set myself goals every week, if I achieve these goals I shall reward myself, this should help keep myself motivated and should help me to produce better work and have a more consistent work flow. I shall record how well I do this every week and try to better myself every week.

## 3 - Not Asking For Help Last Minute
This has been a big issue of mine for a long time, last year  I didn't ask for help at all however this year I've been asking for help but I tend to do it at the last minute. To stop myself doing this I need to ask when I'm first stuck instead of leaving it until weeks after when it's not as relevant anymore, this will also help me produce better work on a more consistent basis. To measure this I will try to track when I get stuck and when I've asked for help.

## 4 - Self help
This term I struggled more than I ever have with my own mental health and it played such a huge part on my work. I've come to realise that student support is there and that from now on I should go and see them immediately when I'm feeling down instead of leaving that until my deadlines are only a few days away. After all how I feel should be my number one priority. To help me track this I shall start keeping a diary of how I feel and any problems I come across in my everyday life.

## 5 - Communicate Better With Others
I've never been the best at communicating with others, especially those I don't know very well. This has come up a few times while making our team game and it is something I am working to improve on. To help me improve on it I am trying to be more vocal during stand ups and push my ideas more to my team. To help me measure this I am hoping my peer review feedback goes up for our game group. 

# Term Two
## Week One - Beginning 29th January
First week back for the second term and everything went fairly well. On Monday we had a lecture with Ed about AI which is good because I need to learn about AI to make it for our team game. On Tuesday we had a lecture about servers with Gareth this was a lot more interesting than I thought it'd be. On Wednesday we had a lecture about business and marketing which I found enjoyable and useful. The rest of the week I was working on my team game in which my hardest struggle was finding things to work on as there isn't a lot left on the trello board so we're waiting on the designers for more.

## Week Two - Beginning 5th February
Second week back and everything was going well, we had a few lectures on AI, business and remote networking, I am already enjoying these modules and I hope to take lots out of these becasue they are very useful when it comes to making and trying to sell games. I didn't really struggle with anything this week as we are just getting back into the swing of things.

## Week Three - Beginning 12th February
This week we had to show off our AI proposals which gave me more insight on how to make my AI which I found useful. Gareth showed us a client chat system which I have begun to look at, at home trying to figure out what is going on. However I spent most of my time this week working on our team game banging out some tasks which needed done. The biggest challenge this week was again waiting on more work to program for the game.

## Week Four - Beginning 19th February
This week I spent most of my time working on my MUD, I spent so long on it this week because I only realised it was due next week and had to get it working. After a few days of playing around with it and some help from Gareth I managed to get two + clients working on it at the same time, if I have any time left next week I'll attempt to add chat. Our team game is coming along very well compared to how it was coming before the challenge is now finding things to work on for it as I'm doing the AI work at home in my own time. The designers aren't doing design work which makes it hard for us programmers.

## Week Five - Beginning 26th February
This week I already assumed my biggest struggle would be presenting my business case, however this was not the case, my business case went a lot better than I expected and I think this is due to the fact we only had to present it to Gareth. One person is fine but when you add more to the equation my anxiety goes up, also Gareth is very easy going. As mentioned a long time ago, my public speaking abilities are something I'd like to work on but find very hard.

## Week Six - Beginning 5th March
This week was reading week, I just worked on the game for the whole week.

## Week Seven - Beginning 12th March
This week I realized the behaviour trees I was using for my AI didn't work exactly how I wanted it too for what I needed it to do, so I reverted back to using event graphs and construction scripts which has made it much easier to do my game AI as there aren't that many states. I spent weeks trying to get it to work how I wanted it too with behaviour trees but there was a new issue popping up every day so it was time for change.

## Week Eight - Beginning 19th March
This week my biggest stress this week was trying to make sure all my work was done in time for my deadlines this week and up to a standard I was happy with. I really stress at every deadline even if I know everything will be fine. I managed this with a day to spare for my last one, I was happy with this as I feel my business case turned out to be quite a good piece or work. The research journals this term weren't my facorite as we were assigned our own topics, some people got topics I was way more interested in and I got stuck with something I wouldn't choose for myself, that's just how things go.

## Week Nine - Beginning 9th April
This week we're back to uni for the third term, not long left to go, the pressure is starting to hit me hard. As term is winding down and people are starting to get ready for Summer this is when I need to work the hardest to ensure everything is done. Time is moving very quickly. My biggest struggle is managing my time effectively, I have never been good at this and probably plays a large part in the enormous stress I face.

## Week Ten - Beginning 16th April
This week I got my game AI working how I wanted it to and began looking at the API for MicroRTS. I was feeling quite stressed knowing all the work is due in very soon. My biggest struggle this week was getting my game AI to work how I wanted it to due to the poor design of the map I had to change it to construction scripts and get some help from Brian as to what to do.

## Week Eleven - Beginning 23rd April
This week I spent the majority of my time working on my Micro RTS bot, this has been one of my favorite modules we've had, I just wish I started work on it sooner. The stress is going away a little bit knowing I have done most of my work up to a standard that will get me a passing grade, there is only one thing I am stressed about now and that is the networking module as I haven't played around with it enough yet to know what I am doing. I submitted my game this week, it turned out OK in the end, I wish there were more jump scares, but people actually seemed to be scared of my AI which pleased me.
