# Weekly Reports

## Week 1 - Beginning 25th September
The most challenging thing this week was presenting my world idea to my team. I had practiced presenting beforehand so I feel like it was an improvement over my presentations last year, however I was still quite nervous and felt like I rushed it. I also found the SDL and OpenGL programming quite overwhelming but brians live coding video helped me to understand it a bit better.

## Week 2 - Beginning 2nd October
This week I found the OpenGL programming quite challenging as It was still very overwhelming and I still don't understand it all. I plan to practice this and hopefully begin to understand how it all works. It was also quite hard to come up with a research topic for my ethics essay.

## Week 3 - Beginnng 9th October
This week my team decided that we will most likely be using unity to develop our game. Trying to learn scripting in C# has been the biggest challenge for me this week, I plan to practice using C# in unity at least 5 hours hours a week. I will watch video tutorials as well as implement to the team game to practice.

## Week 4 - Beginning 16th October
This week it was fairly challenging to come up with an interesting essay topic for the ethics essay, I spent quite a lot of time researching ethical issues in the games industry and eventually had an idea of what to base my essay on. I am still struggling with scripting in unity, I plan to spend more time working on the game and asking the BA programmer in my team when I get stuck. I was also focused on the evualtion of the usability of my previous year game for the peer review next week, this wasn't too challenging however it was fairly time consumming to get a good amount of participants to test the game.

## Week 5 - Beginning 23rd October
This week was focused on finsihing the usability report, this was not particularly challenging but it took some time to analyse all the data i had collected. We also moved onto model loading and textures in OpenGL which I am still finding difficult to fully understand, I understand it on a basic level, however I struggle when It comes to actually implementing it in C++. After watching brians live code video I feel I am starting to become more familiar with it but definetly still need more practice. I plan to work on my OpenGL project for 5-10 hours each week, especially as it is a 90% the comp220 module. 

## Week 6 - Beginning 30th October
This was studio practice week, however I spent the majority of this week catching up with the three essays that were due within a few weeks. I found it challenging to find motivation to work on my collaborative game, this Is something I need to improve. I shouldn't rely on motivation to work on things, I will overcome this by working on my team game or any other module whether I am motivated or not. This comes back to bad time management which Is something I am always trying to improve by setting myself goals each week for each of my differnt modules and assignments.

## Week 7 - Beginning 6th November
I got very stressed this week as there were three essays due next week, this happened to me a few times last year especially with essays. I tend to leave the majority of essay work until the week before it is due and then I get stressed out because I worry I won't be able to get it all done in time to a good standard. I ended up staying up all night to finish the last of the three essays which left me being extremely tired for lectures and studio practice the next day. This is something I want to avoid in future, I will do this by working on essays in chunks rather than all in the week before the deadline. 

## Week 8 - Beginning 13th November
I felt very relived this week after submitting my essays, however I then realised that because I had been spending so much time on them for the last couple weeks that I had not been working on my other assignments as much as I should have. I began planning out what I was going to do for my AR/VR task at the start of this week and didn't really know how I would develop it. After the comp210 workshop I watched the pluralsight tutorial on hololens which was very helpful and really kickstarted the development of my prototpye. This is a common problem for me, I think something will be easy until I try to do it then I get stuck. To overcome this I will try not to underestimate challenges and use tutorials to get me started with things I don't quite understand, such as developing for hololens.

## Week 9 - Beginning 20th November
This week the majority of my team agreed on making a new game because we were struggling to develop the previous game due to motivation issues and not really knowing how to make the game enjoyable. I was very happy with this as I wasn't enjoying developing the previous game and the new one sounded a lot more fun. However we were then faced with the challenge of creating a game with less than a month until the alpha hand in. This tested my ability to program in C# but also improved it, I found myself stuck trying to solve the same problem for hours sometimes and not asking for help. This is one of my flaws, I shy away from asking for help and tend to try and figure stuff out by myself, which can sometimes be okay, but a lot of the time it would be highly beneficial to me if I asked for some help. To overcome this I plan to ask for help whenever I can instead of wasting time trying to solve it by myself.

## Week 10 - Beginning 27th November
During this week I spent a lot of time working on my hololens project, I was having problems deploying my game to the hololens which was making it harder to develop because I couldn't test the game. After asking Al for some help I managed to get it working and I could test the game. I'm glad I asked for help rather than spending hours trying to figure it out by myself. A big challenge I faced was implementing a random item spawner for my collaborative game, I couldn't figure out how to ensure that an item wouldn't spawn in a used spawn point. I didn't ask for help for this and it took me a long time to solve this problem. I believe if I was more proficient at C# it would not have taken me so long so I plan to do a couple hours of C# practice a at least two days each week.
