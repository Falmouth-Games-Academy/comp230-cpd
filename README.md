# Weekly Reports

## Week One
Surprisingly, the first week back at Uni has been quite full on, with the introduction of 3 new modules, there was quite a lot to take on, especially 220, which was quite heavy on both the theory and coding fronts, and being that I have been keeping up with my coding skills as much as I liked to have over the Summer, I found it quite hard to get back into the tasks given out by Brian, which could lead me to fall behind on my work as the weeks progress, so to overcome this issue, I will follow his tutorial videos that he has put up for the tasks and see if I can complete them, if not I'll make sure that I consult with him in the guild on Friday. 

## Week Two
This week's challenge stems from my collaboritive project with the BAs, as the programmers on my team are used to using Unity over Unreal, and although I have some experience with Unity, I feel that I will be at a disadvantage in comparison to them, where my work may take longer and may endanger the project, so to help with this challenge, I will follow the Unity Basics tutorials and get myself back up to speed with c#, meaning I will be able to keep up with the workflow that comes with the project, and not let the rest of my team down.
