# Weekly Reports

## Week One

I presented my world pitch, which made me really nervous and started all my modules nothing too difficult yet.

## Week Two

Learnt how to have a dialogue about ethics. Al taught us about heuristics but all the data types and interviewing/ questionaire methods are 
so confusing, they're so similar. When I start using the different methods I'm sure they will become more familiar and less confusing.

## Week Three

The maths in the graphics and simulations module is getting really tough and I'm feeling a bit lost with the C++, I will have to study it in my spare time.

## Week Four

I had flu all week so missed my lessons but worked on my assignments and live coding tutorials.

## Week Five

The graphics and Simulation module is becoming increasingly difficult following the live coding videos are easy but I'm really not understanding anything. The game progress pitch with my team went really well.

## Week Six

Studio practice all week no lessons, my group game is going really well. I had to create camera movement on key presses and mouse position for graphics and simualtion which I found incredibly hard, I found the code that preformed that fuction but put them in the wrong place within the main.cpp which Brian helped me with.

## Week Seven

I spent most of this week finnishing assignments and making sure my entry in the maths library was correct. I found that I have forgotton my understanding of header files in C++ which I must re-learn to improve my coding skills. My graphics and simulation peer review I think went well, even though I had trouble making it, I did succeed in the end.

## Week Eight

3 assignments due in this week, due to my good time management skills they are all finished and ready to hand in. There was also a peer-review on the ethics assignment before its hand in. I learnt that I create very long sentences but I think this also shows that I still don't understand puctuation which deffinatly needs to improve.
