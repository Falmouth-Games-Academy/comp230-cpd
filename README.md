# Weekly Reports

## Week 1

The most challenging thing this week was presenting my world idea to my team. I had practiced presenting beforehand so I feel like it was an improvement over my presentations last year, however I was still quite nervous and felt like I rushed it. I also found the SDL and OpenGL programming quite overwhelming but brians live coding video helped me to understand it a bit better.

## Week 2

This week I found the OpenGL programming quite challenging as It was still very overwhelming and I still don't understand it all. I plan to practice this and hopefully begin to understand how it all works. It was also quite hard to come up with a research topic for my ethics essay. 

## Week 3

This week my team decided that we will most likely be using usnity to develop our game. Trying to learn C# has been the biggest challenge for me this week, I plan to practice C# at least 10 hours hours a week.
